# TODO

# - Fix ms -> seconds units in output
# - Fix text inversion
# - Find out if we need to match CInt behaviour with round in the EprimeSummation class.
# - Remove unneeded stuff from images folders
# - Add the closing screens after the second training loop terminates
# - Terminate practice loop early if the mean rt is greater than zero
# - Check for the bug which bj sent
# - Add ctrl-shift-alt "Would you like to abort the experiment" message.
# - Fix the thing which takes down puts up a blank screen when the stimulus end.  Maybe not do that or pass a flag.
# - Start timing the stimulus duration after the flip, not before the text is generated.
# - Demo text size bug and submit it to discourse.psychopy and then, conditionally, bug tracker
