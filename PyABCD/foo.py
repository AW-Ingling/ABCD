# TODO
# - Add ctrl-shift-alt "Would you like to abort the experiment" message.
# - Check what is supposed to happen when the user presses late.  Now, it appears to skip the conclusion statement.
# - Fix the text width for the message, it wraps
# - Fix the response, it says that a key has been pressed.
# - Fix the thing which takes down puts up a blank screen when the stimulus end.  Maybe not do that or pass a flag.
# - Start timing the stimulus duration after the flip, not before the text is generated.
# - Time the text presentation.
# - Demo text size bug and submit it to discourse.psychopy and then, conditionally, bug tracker
